                The frequent interaction of human beings with aviation and space technologies in the twenty
                and twenty-first century has facilitated the growth of International Air and Space Law as a
                specialized field of legal study. The regulation of International Aviation has been a matter of
                specialized discussion and debates ever since the Wright Brothers flew in the sky and Vostok
                1 conducted the first successful human spaceflight. Initially freedom in air and the sovereignty
                of the states over airspace was the starting point of these debates. Later on, more complex
                issues of international aviation contracts, public international legal regulations on aviation
                and space activities, air traffic management, liabilities in case of accidents, environmental
                regulation, aviation finance joined the club.

                Very lately with the launch of Bangabandhu Satellite-1, Bangladesh entered the space age.
                However, there was no scope for pursuing a comprehensive study on the entire legal regime
                on air, aviation and space in the South Asian region. Therefore, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
                Rahman Aviation and Aerospace University (BSMRAAU) has taken the noble initiative to
                introduce a specialized LLM program International Air and Space Law (IASL). The LLM
                program on IASL aims to develop an extraordinary circuit of legal professionals specialized on
                aviation and space matters.
